    Executive functioning requires a combination of skills such as goal-setting, time management, organization, motivation, concentration, and memory."

    Children can use similar methods such as playing on supportive sports teams, practicing mindfulness, or engaging in activities that promote executive functioning (e.g. running a 
    lemonade stand, playing educational games, participating in a school sport or theatre, etc.)."

    v$text <- "What this is: having positive parental figures often manifests in having caregivers who are attentive, caring, and present. Caregivers are extremely important because the home environment 
    is core to how a child's stress response develops. More specifically, caregivers who are caring, attentive, and confident about their parenting are more likely to rear children with 
    high resilience compared to those who are not. In fact, Collishaw et al. (2007) did a study in which they asked whether or not people had at least one caring parent during their childhood. 
    Among those who did, 61.5% showed resilience in adulthood versus only 20% of those who did not have at least one caring parent."
    v$examples <- "How to build this in children: if you are a parent do not underestimate the effect that your actions have on your child. Do what you can to treat them with kindness and 
    help them feel safe. Seek support from doctors, support groups, or classes if you feel that you could improve your parenting."

    infants who were exposed to maternal depression, 32.2% of them grew up to be resilient while 67.8% did not. One of the biggest predictors of 
    resilience among those whose mothers were depressed was that their mothers felt positively about their parenting."
    v$examples <- "How to build this in children: if you are a parent and are struggling with your mental health or a lack of confidence about your parenting,

    In a population-based health survey with over 13,000 participants, Nurius, Green, Logan-Greene, & Borja (2015) found that people with high ACE scores who had 
    healthy sleep schedules and got regular exercise missed very little work and other activities as a result of mental health problems, while those who had both poor 
    sleep and exercise habits and high ACE scores missed multiple days of work and activities. Routines are also very helpful for building healthy stress response systems 
    and creating a sense of control and safety (Traub & Boynton-Jarrett, 2017)."
    v$examples <- "How to build this: practice regular healthy eating, sleeping, and exercising. Even a little bit of any of these can be impactful.

    v$examples <- "How to build this: for children specifically, learning about their trauma and working through it in the company of their caregivers is particularly meaningful 
    and valuable for building resilience (Traub & Boynton-Jarrett, 2017). This can also involve learning basic techniques to calm one’s potentially dysregulated stress response 
    systems such as breathing and mindfulness. For adults, exploring resources pertaining to ACEs and toxic stress can be valuable in explaining the way that their body 
    works and responds. This can potentially lift damaging blame, and help to start a healing process. Working through the past with a professional or support groups can 
    also promote resilience."
